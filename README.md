# Hello

Thanks for taking the time to review my application. In order to run the application, clone this repostitory and run `mvn install`. Navigate to the target directory and run `java -jar yotibackendtest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. From there, send any input in the form of application/json to http://localhost:8080/clean.
